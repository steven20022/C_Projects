/*
 * each variable and function gets stored in memory (in the stack).
 * the location in memory to where it's' stored is referred to as
 * its address. unlike other variables that store values of a 
 * certain type (like int, float, ect.), a pointer is a variable
 * that stores an address. an integer variable stored an integer
 * value. an integer pointer stores the address of an integer
 * variable. we can have pointers ot characters, integers, doubles, ect.
 * we can even have pointers to functions. pointers get stored
 * in the heap.
